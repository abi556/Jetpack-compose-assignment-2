## 🚀 How It Works

1. **On launch**, the app loads cached todos from Room and displays them instantly.
2. **Fetches fresh data** from the remote API and updates the local cache.
3. **Displays todos** in a modern, Material3-styled list.
4. **Tap a todo** to view its details on a separate screen.
5. **Handles errors** gracefully and works offline with cached data.

## 📝 Notes

- The app uses the public JSONPlaceholder API, which is read-only.  
  Adding, editing, or deleting todos is not supported by the API.
- The app is designed for demonstration and educational purposes.
